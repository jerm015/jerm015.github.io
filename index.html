      Aspiring Machine Learning Professional | Leveraging Diverse Experience in

    </div>
    <div class="w-text textalignStart fontsizeSmall fontfamilyCharter paddingleft12 paddingright12">
      <br /><br />I&#x27;m a passionate student currently immersed in the world
      of Machine Learning, excited to apply my unique blend of skills and
      experiences to this cutting-edge field. My background in the service
      industry has honed my ability to work efficiently in fast-paced
      environments, communicate effectively with diverse groups, and solve
      problems creatively - all skills I believe will translate well to the tech
      world.<br />My time as an Au Pair and extensive travel experiences have
      broadened my perspective, teaching me adaptability, cultural sensitivity,
      and the value of continuous learning. These qualities, combined with my
      strong foundation in psychology, give me a unique lens through which to
      approach Machine Learning challenges, particularly in areas like user
      behavior prediction and human-computer interaction.<br />As I navigate my
      transition into the tech industry, I&#x27;m eager to connect with
      professionals in Machine Learning and related fields. I&#x27;m
      particularly interested in opportunities that blend my people-centric
      background with innovative ML applications, such as:<br /><br />Natural
      Language Processing<br />Recommendation Systems<br />Computer Vision<br />Ethical
      AI and bias mitigation<br /><br />I&#x27;m open to internships,
      entry-level positions, or collaborative projects that will allow me to
      apply my coursework in real-world scenarios. Let&#x27;s connect if
      you&#x27;re working on exciting ML projects or if you have advice for
      someone starting their journey in this field!

      <br />Fairytale Character Dating Website<br />Aug 2024 - Aug 2024<br /><br />This
      project was created for Atlas School. The goal was to put the full-stack
      skills we recently learned to the test. We were given a theme of
      &quot;Folklore and Fairytales.&quot; With this, my partners and I decided
      to create a website that mimicked a dating website. We added ten different
      fairytale characters, with which users could either &quot;heart&quot;
      (like) or &quot;X&quot; (dislike). In the backend JavaScript, the
      characters were randomized so that each user sees them in a different
      order. Once a person &quot;matches&quot; with a character, they are then
      prompted with the option to chat with the character. Here&#x27;s where my
      portion of the project came into play. I implemented an AI chat box, using
      Claude AI through Amazon Bedrock. Using JavaScript, I provided the
      interface with descriptions of each character so that it knew the correct
      way to respond, including but not limited to the length of words to
      respond with.
